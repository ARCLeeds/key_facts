Original statement was

Leeds has one of the leading institutional HPC facilities in the UK.
We are committed to invest in hardware upgrades every two years and to provide on-going technical expertise and support. 
We also lead, with Manchester, a regional HPC consortium of eight northern English Universities (“N8”), resulting in the N8 HPC system being hosted by Leeds.
Hence our CDT students will get access to over 10000 computational cores, currently, and benefit from the future upgrades.
