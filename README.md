# Key facts and figures about Research Computing at Leeds

### Training 

* 40.5 training days delivered in 2017-18 academic year, providing ~630 researcher training days.
* 6 two-day Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshops providing training opportunities to a further 108 researchers in a range of computational and data science skills.

## Local High Performance Computing

* We have over 14,000 processor cores with a total 50Tb RAM and 46 GPUs for use by University of Leeds researchers
* There are just under 1,000 University of Leeds users (Approximately 1/3 of our resarch population)
* We now have about 2-3 times the number of active users of the ARC service than we did 5 years ago. Since investment in both people and equipment has remained static, the amount of support and resource available per researcher has dropped.
* We are probably heading for a contraction in the number of cores next year as quite of kit is getting old and we have insufficient investment to replace at a similar level.

## Regional High Performance Computing

* We have also been running an additional 5,500 cores  as a regional machine on behalf of the N8 Research Partnership (soon to be 
decommissioned)
* 500  external users of the N8 machine.
