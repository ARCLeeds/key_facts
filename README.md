# Key facts and figures about Research Computing at Leeds

### Training 

* 40.5 training days delivered in 2017-18 academic year, providing ~630 researcher training days.
* 6 two-day Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshops providing training opportunities to a further 108 researchers in a range of computational and data science skills.

## Local High Performance Computing

* We have over 14,000 processor cores with a total 50Tb RAM and 46 GPUs for use by University of Leeds researchers
* There are just under 1,000 University of Leeds users (Approximately 1/3 of our resarch population)
* We now have about 2-3 times the number of active users of the ARC service than we did 5 years ago. Since investment in both people and equipment has remained static, the amount of support and resource available per researcher has dropped.
* We are probably heading for a contraction in the number of cores next year as quite of kit is getting old and we have insufficient investment to replace at a similar level.

* 2016 (ARC3, Dell) - 302 gbp/core  [167 nodes (4008 cores) + 2 GPU nodes(4 GPUs) => cost equiv to "96" std cores / 1239348.0 gbp]
* 2017 (ARC3.5, Dell) - 295 gbp/core  [121 nodes (2904 cores) + 6 GPU nodes(24 GPUs) => cost equiv to "576" std cores / 1027606.42 gbp ]


## Regional High Performance Computing

* We have also been running an additional 5,312 cores  as a regional machine on behalf of the N8 Research Partnership (soon to be 
decommissioned)
* 500  external users of the N8 machine.
* Also has 192 cores owned by a research group in MAPS

## Integrated Research Campus

* The IRC provides trained and authorised researchers with monitored access to datasets which they can manipulate and analyse. Using a safe haven that prevents unauthorised copying, with RSA 2-Factor secure ID authentication technology.
* With 640 cores (600 useable) with 3.52TB RAM (2.64TB useable) and 1.79PB Storage (716TB useable) compute infrastructure. 
* Citrix virtual research environment (VRE) with integrated research applications and tools including; Python, R, Stata and Microsoft SQL Server, plus many more. 
* ISO 27001 certification
