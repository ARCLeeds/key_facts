As requested, over the next 12 months we will (probably) be losing:
  1/8th of Polaris (5312/8 = 664 cores)
  Arc2: (3040 cores, plus private nodes)
  
Arc4 will probably replace the 3040 we're losing from A2, but until we know how 
much we can spend we can't really estimate that core count.

Phi/KNL is a bit of a dead-end tech.
GPU is useful but we might want to consider spending in a similar way to A3, ie:
  First tranche of funding we buy a few GPUs and mostly general purpose nodes
  2nd tranche we take a greater look at novel architectures, should the community 
  wish.

Anything else?
